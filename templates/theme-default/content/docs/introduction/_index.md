# Kon'nichiwa 👋

The WEKit Design System is a reusable component library that helps contributors build UIs faster.

## Design System 🎨

- `design-tokens` are platform-agnostic variables that represent the look and feel of your brand or product. Example: **colors**
- `components` are the basic building blocks and the smallest functional unit. They are used in modules and cannot stand alone. Example: **c-button**
- `modules` can be used as a full-width section within templates. They can contain components. Example: **m-stage**
- `templates` are the skeleton of a page and may contain modules. Example: **t-article**

## Todos ✅

- Custom Docs: Import CHANGELOG.md
- Custom Docs: Allow inline stories
- Story: Implement [@storybook/addon-controls](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@storybook/addon-controls) with some simple examples
- Story: Make breakpoints in viewport toolbar customizable
